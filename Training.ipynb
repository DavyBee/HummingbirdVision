    "# Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this notebook if you want to further train the models on new data, or if you want to train the models from scratch from the pretrained weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is just a simple copy and paste from Ultralytics' model training framework. Their documentation can be found here ([Ultralytics Model Train Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/)) and contains much more depth than what will be explained here. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you run the code block below, ultralytics will begin the training process. This requires a dataset of labeled images formatted in the YOLO format. Once it is complete, the code will save a `best.pt` file which contains the trained model weights of the epoch which reported the best overall combination of metrics. You can select this model (or any other epoch if you choose to save them with the `epoch` keyword). Move it to the model_weights folder already present in the root directory, and rename it to either `YOLO.pt` or `DETR.pt` depending on which model architecture you chose to train. The file names for the weights must be exactly `YOLO.pt` or `DETR.pt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The YOLO or RTDETR models can be fine-tuned on top of the Ultralytics pretrained models, or from any models that you have previously pre-trained (including the models already in `model_weights`). Follow the link above for general training info. [This](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/#performance-metrics) has information on the pretrained YOLO model options, and [This](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/rtdetr/) has information on the pretrained RTDETR model options. I recommend the large versions for both models for a good mix of best accuracy with reasonable timing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, if your training is interrupted, you can continue the training by making a model with the `last.pt` file, then running predict with the keyword `resume = True`. \n",

    "This is the path to the data that you wish to train on. The training data must be in YOLO11 form. Datasets can be easily created, labeled, and then downloaded in the correct format on [Roboflow](https://app.roboflow.com) for example.\n",

    "### Optional:\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the following are optional keywords, but can affect how the training process occurs. My defaults when training were: <br>\n",

    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "`batch`\n",
    "&nbsp;\\\n",
    "This determines how many batches of frames are given to the model at a time. If you give it a decimal value, it will use up that amount of space as a percentage of your GPU's RAM capabilities. I used `batch = 0.9` to use 90% of the GPU RAM. Higher values increaes storage, but can decrease training time. Play around with it to find a solid value for your machine.\n",
    "&nbsp; <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "`save_period`\n",
    "&nbsp;\\\n",
    "This determines how often an epoch is saved to your machine from training. I set this to 1 to save every epoch so I could determine the best one, but this increases the amount of space training takes up in your storage. Each epoch is around 100 MB. By default, the \"best\" epoch (which is determined by a combination of max precision, recall, and other metrics calculated by Ultralytics) is automatically saved if you don't specify this keyword. But if you want to manually evaluate the differences in epochs, set this to a lower number.\n",
